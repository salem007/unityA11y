# unityA11y
UnityA11y is an AI-powered static analysis tool designed as a Unity Editor extension. It assists developers in identifying and resolving accessibility issues within Unity projects by leveraging a dependency-aware scanner and a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) model to provide context-specific feedback based on WCAG guidelines, directly within the development environment.
